## What features does InstiApp have?
Some features that are currently available are
* A comprehensive feed of all the events happening around the institute
* Mess Menus of all hostels
* Placement and Training Blogs
* Unique pages for all bodies, events and users
* Insti news collated from blogs of major bodies
* Institute calendar which will have information of all the events
* Notifications for new events, updates on events, mentions in PT blogs and so on.
* Quick links for CMS, Academic time table and calendar, VPN, etc.

## Who fills in the events and other data?
Everything is done by POR holders! If you're a manager/convener or equivalent for a club/IB, login to InstiApp and let us know so we can grant you permissions on your club.

## My hostel has no mess menu ...
Ask your mess councillors/secretaries to update it! For those responsible, you just have to update a Google Sheet, which will automatically update data in the app hourly.

## What happens when I follow events/clubs?
When you follow an event, you'll get notification when/if the event is updated. Following a body will get events of the body higher priority in your feed and notifications for new events/news.

## How to add an event?
To add an event, go to Calendar, select a date and click the add event button in the bottom right corner. It is **highly recommended** that you upload an image, since this could have an effect on how high your event is in the feed. Next you need to add a title, description and choose the organizations and venues. Always choose venues from suggestions instead of writing the full name. Doing so will ensure better priority and other features in the future. When you're done, click the Create Event button.

## How to update an event?
On an event page, you should see a pencil icon, clicking which should open the update page. Note that updating events sends out notifications to all people interested/going to the event.

## How to add events with multiple bodies?
Approach a higher authority with permissions on all bodies to create the event if multiple bodies are conducting an event. For example, if WnCC and Krittika are conducting an event together, approach the GSTA. If Insync and Mood Indigo are conducting an event together, approach the InstiApp team.

## I don't see a button to add events
Currently, only the website has functionality to add events. Make sure you're not in the Android app. Next, try opening a new browser window and logout/login if you've just been granted permissions. Contact the team if something still doesn't work.

## What's News?
News is collected from blogs. If you're managing a club, you can see a pencil icon on the body page to edit your body, where you can change the blog feed URL. Make sure the URL leads to an Atom/RSS feed. Contact the team for more help.
